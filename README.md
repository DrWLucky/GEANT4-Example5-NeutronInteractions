# GEANT4-Example5-NeutronInteractions
The type of radiation-matter interactions can be selected via an input argument, argv, that is passed into the main function, i.e. main(int argc, char** argv). As the physics of neutron interactions is particularly difficult to model, for demo purposes several built-in GEANT4 physics lists are made available, namely: FTFP_BERT, FTFP_BERT_HP, QBBC, QGSP_BIC_HP; a suitable value of argv (i.e. the exact, case sensitive name of the desired physics list above) decides which one gets included into program compilation. Besides these, a very important example of an explicit physics list with neutron interactions is furnished by GEANT4 example found in the extended/hadronic/Hadr06 directory of GEANT4 installation. The neutron physics code found therein is utilised here; it is placed (without significant changes) in the directory main/neutronPhysicsList-extendedHadr06. To choose this latter neutron physics list for compilation, the value passed into argv must be: neutronPhysicsList.
